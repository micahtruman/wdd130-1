      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I would like to make a website or blog that sells digital art prints and NFTs. I think everyone should have art in their homes and my website will help provide people with many options of art that they can order. I want it to be for independent artists that want to have a platform to sell their art and make the most money. I will charge a $4 service fee for every transaction that’s it though, all the rest of the money will go to the artist. I think it will be a site like ETSY or eBay.  I want it to have that layout. It can help me earn some money and help artists make money and share their art.
        Feedback from other: I talked to my dad about it, and he liked the idea, he said though how will I be able to sell stuff when there is like Amazon that can sell art prints and stuff too, so why would people come to my site? I said because I guess my site will be more niche and not as big as Amazon, I will only have art for sale on the website. I talked to my mom about it and she liked it and didn’t really have much bad to say about it. She has a successful blog, and she gave me some tips and stuff and she said it was good to have it narrowed down to a specific niche, it would help me find more specific customers. I asked my friends about it and they thought it was a good idea and that since like NFT’s and stuff is kind of big right now that people would like that, and they think art is cool to and that more people should own art work, they like illustration though not really like oil painting like me.
    </p> 
    

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience would probably be younger people, most likely in the age range of 14-44 and mostly males. I think it could be for art students or anyone that likes to just look at art!</p>  <!-- change this -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        [Some information that is necessary to complete any action the site offers is information about times and pricing, I feel like this is the most important thing to do. Also, a way people can get tickets for the museum, they ca neither do it online or in person, and people will want to know pricing. This will help them decide if they want to keep scrolling on the website and look for other features that can help them. I think I will need to have a lot of navigation tabs and a lot of paragraph tabs.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Different types of activities that people will want to complete on my site will to be to easily find the dates and time for the website, be able to get tickets for certain exabits, look at featured collections and artist, to donate to the museum, to be able to sign up for news and updates through an email.

      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>
        [They will want to learn more about art history and more about why art is important for our society. For example, maybe I’ll but a blog page with art history they can read about, for the featured exbibits and they will be more educated when they go and look at the featured artwork.]

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        [Some questions people might ask are what are the days and times that the museum is open? How much does it cost to go for the day? Is there a dress code for this museum? Is any of the artwork for sale? Where does the art come from? Are there tour guides? If so, are they free or do they cost money? If they cost money, how much? Are there different languages they translate the tours in? Are there any painting classes to sign up for? Is there a shop to buy art, like a souvenir shop but for art? What types of art are in this museum? Whats the collections? ]
